This project is still under construction.
The gui part used PyQt5+Vue.js.
To read the mdx and mdd file it used a flask RESTful server in a thread.

Mapledict is a super super great dictionary software system.
Mapledict will beat all the exsiting dictionary software.+
Mapledict is crossplatform, which will provide releases for Windows, Linux and MacOS.

#How to use 
We will provide releases for different platforms. 
You just need to put mdx and mdd files into the content folder
However, if you have python3 installed, you can just run the MapleDict.py script.
